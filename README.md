This repository demonstrates how to implement a DQN reinforcement learning algorithm to play the CartPole game with TensorFlow 2.0.

## Getting started

### Run in Colab

Open [colab_script.ipynb](./colab_script.ipynb) and then click on the badge `Open in Colab` located on the top of the notebook.

### Run locally

First create a virtual environment (recommended).

Then, run the following command with the virtual environment is activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start training

```bash
python entrypoint.py
```

### Run in streamlit

```bash
streamlit run entrypoint.py
```
